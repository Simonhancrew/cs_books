\ldots when Einstein introduced his formula
\begin{equation}
	e = m \cdot c^2 \;,
\end{equation}
which is at the same time the most widely known.


\ldots from which follows Kirchhoff's current law:
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k = 0 \; .
\end{equation}
Kirchhoff's voltage law can be derived \ldots

\ldots which has several advantages.

\begin{equation}
	I_D = I_F - I_R
\end{equation}
is the core of a very different transistor model. \ldots
